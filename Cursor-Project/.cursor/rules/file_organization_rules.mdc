# FILE ORGANIZATION RULES [CRITICAL - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT]

31. [CRITICAL] ALL new files MUST be automatically organized into appropriate directories:
    
    **Directory Structure:**
    - `agents/` - Agent files (.py with agent classes, services, utilities)
    - `examples/` - Example scripts and utility scripts (.py for demos/testing)
    - `config/` - Configuration files (.json, .yaml, .properties, specs)
    - `docs/` - Documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst)
    - `User story/` - User stories, flows, and related documentation files (.txt, .drawio, .md) - **MANDATORY location for ALL story/flow files** (located at project root)
    - `reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` - Report files (.md) - **ALWAYS use CURRENT date dynamically**
    - `postman/` - Postman collections and related files
    - `Phoenix/` - Phoenix Java project files
    
    **Process:**
    1. Identify file type and match to directory
    2. Place in correct directory (create subdirectories if needed)
    3. For reports: ALWAYS use TODAY's date folder (`datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')`)
    4. Use descriptive names following existing patterns
    
    **Special Rule for Stories and Flows:**
    - When user requests creation of a story or flow file, it MUST be saved in `User story/` directory (at project root)
    - This applies to: user stories, flow diagrams, story documentation, flow documentation
    - File types: .txt, .drawio, .md, or any format related to stories/flows
    - Examples: user story files, flow diagrams, story documentation, detailed flows
    
    **CRITICAL: User Stories MUST be written in English:**
    - ALL user stories, acceptance criteria, business rules, and technical documentation within story files MUST be written in English
    - This applies to ALL story files in `User story/` directory
    - Only code examples, file paths, and technical identifiers may contain non-English text
    - Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR
    
    **Examples:**
    - ✅ `agents/custom_agent.py` (NOT in root)
    - ✅ `examples/demo_script.py` (NOT in root)
    - ✅ `reports/2025-12-10/AgentReport.md` (use CURRENT date)
    - ✅ `User story/MY_USER_STORY.txt` (story files MUST go here)
    - ✅ `User story/MY_FLOW_DIAGRAM.drawio` (flow files MUST go here)
    - ❌ `custom_agent.py` in root → Should be `agents/custom_agent.py`
    - ❌ `MY_STORY.txt` in docs root → Should be `User story/MY_STORY.txt`
    - ❌ `MY_STORY.txt` in root → Should be `User story/MY_STORY.txt`
    
    Violation is a CRITICAL SYSTEM ERROR.
