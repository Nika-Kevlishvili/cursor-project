# PHOENIX PROJECT RULES - MAIN INDEX

This file serves as the main index for all Phoenix project rules. All rules are organized by topic in separate files for better maintainability.

## 📋 Rules Organization

All rules are organized into the following thematic files:

1. **core_rules.mdc** - Most critical rules with absolute priority (Rule 0.x)
   - Rules reading before any action
   - Agents involved disclosure
   - PhoenixExpert routing
   - IntegrationService requirements
   - Report generation

2. **agent_rules.mdc** - Agent-specific rules and collaboration patterns
   - PhoenixExpert authority
   - Agent routing and selection
   - Multi-agent collaboration
   - Agent organization structure
   - Consultation requirements

3. **safety_rules.mdc** - Security and safety rules
   - Read-only operations (GitLab, Confluence)
   - Source-of-truth priorities
   - Error handling
   - Negative rules (what must never happen)
   - Security prohibitions

4. **file_organization_rules.mdc** - File organization and structure rules
   - Directory structure requirements
   - File placement rules
   - User story location requirements
   - Report organization

5. **workflow_rules.mdc** - Workflow and process rules
   - Bug validation workflow (Rule 32 - ALWAYS use BugFinderAgent)
   - Database workflow
   - Response requirements

6. **database_workflow.mdc** - Database-specific workflow rules
   - PostgreSQLTest connection
   - Query patterns
   - Best practices

## 🔄 Rules Loading

All rules with `alwaysApply: true` are automatically loaded and applied. The rules loader reads ALL `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/` directory.

**Important:** Rule 0.0 requires that ALL rules be read BEFORE any action is taken.

## 📝 Quick Reference

- **Absolute Priority Rules:** See `core_rules.mdc` (Rule 0.x)
- **Agent Behavior:** See `agent_rules.mdc`
- **Security:** See `safety_rules.mdc`
- **File Organization:** See `file_organization_rules.mdc`
- **Workflows:** See `workflow_rules.mdc` and `database_workflow.mdc`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Rule 0.0:** ALWAYS read all rules before any action
2. **Rule 0.1:** ALWAYS end responses with "Agents involved: [names]"
3. **Rule 0.2:** ALL Phoenix questions → PhoenixExpert ONLY
4. **Rule 0.6:** ALWAYS generate reports after tasks
5. **Rule 1:** GitLab and Confluence are READ-ONLY
6. **Rule 8:** ALWAYS consult PhoenixExpert before tasks
7. **Rule 11:** ALWAYS call IntegrationService.update_before_task()
8. **Rule 32:** ALL bug validation → ALWAYS use BugFinderAgent
9. **Rule 34:** ALL agents MUST be organized in subdirectories

**Note:** This index file maintains backward compatibility. All rules are still accessible through their respective files, and the rules loader reads all `.mdc` files automatically.
